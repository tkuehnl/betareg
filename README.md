Interview Coding Assignment â€“ Backend

Assignment Description: Design a REST API that allows developers to sign up for the beta test programs of your 
company products.

Proposed Full AWS Architecture approach:

With the time limit, we are only focused on the "Users" portion of the API architecture, this is what I implemented:

Here is the implemented json data structure for a developer:
```json
{
	"id":"pXhwzzlJtQU",
	"registered_at": "2021-03-08T13:32:09.325519",
	"first_name": "Todd",
	"last_name": "Kuehnl",
	"operating_system":"Windows",
	"programming_language":"Javascript",
	"programming_ide":"Visual Studio Code",
	"city":"Troy",
	"state":"MI",
	"country":"USA",
	"email":"todd@rapidtd.com",
	"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-kuehnl-3734911b/",
	"twitter_username":"toddkuehnl",
	"instagram_username":"toddkuehnl"
}
```
I added a health check end point here ( should just return a 200):
https://kky3vgml56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/health

Here is an end-point for fetching all developers:
https://kky3vgml56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/developers

REST endpoint:
https://kky3vgml56.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/developer

With more time, I would also implement a proper CI/CD pipeline such as the following:
